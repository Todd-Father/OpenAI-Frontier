## 📊 Key Research Findings

### AI Agent Security Gaps (2026)

From CISO AI Risk Report:
- 71% of organizations use AI tools accessing core systems
- **Only 16%** effectively govern AI agent access
- 92% lack full visibility into AI identities
- 95% doubt ability to detect/contain AI agent misuse

### Expert Predictions for 2026

- "AI is no longer a feature — it's an actor" (Rosario Mastrogiacomo, SPHERE CSO)
- Autonomous AI agents will cause high-profile data breaches (Jack Cherkas, Syntax Global CISO)
- Defenders will regain advantage against AI-enabled threats (Nicole Reineke, N-able)

### Gartner Forecast

- 40% of enterprise applications will feature task-specific AI agents by 2026
- Only 6% of organizations have advanced AI security strategy
