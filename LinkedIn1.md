🤖 **Building Smarter, Not Harder: My Journey Automating OpenAI Frontier Intelligence**

As our organization prepares for a new partnership with OpenAI Frontier, I faced a challenge: How do I stay current on rapidly evolving AI developments while focusing on security readiness and strategic planning?

**My solution? A fully automated daily digest—built entirely on free tools.** ⚡

**The Stack:**
📧 **SendGrid** - Email delivery (100 emails/day free)
📰 **NewsAPI** - Real-time news aggregation (100 requests/day free)
⚙️ **GitHub Actions** - Workflow automation (2,000 min/month free)
🐍 **Python** - Custom ranking algorithm

**What It Does:**
Every weekday at 7 AM, my system:
✅ Searches for OpenAI Frontier news across authoritative sources
✅ Ranks articles by relevance, recency, and source authority
✅ Generates a formatted digest with key insights
✅ Delivers "Why You Should Care" and "What This Means" analysis
✅ Lands in my inbox—zero manual effort

**The Impact:**
Instead of spending 30 minutes scrolling through search results and RSS feeds, I get a curated, actionable summary in under 2 minutes. This frees me to focus on what matters: building our security framework, engaging with thought leaders, and preparing strategic questions for our partnership.

**Cost? $0/month.** 💰

**Lessons Learned:**
🔹 Automation isn't just for enterprises—free tiers are incredibly powerful
🔹 GitHub Actions is an underrated automation platform
🔹 Small scripts compound into massive time savings
🔹 Document as you build—your future self will thank you

The best part? This approach works for ANY topic you need to track. Cybersecurity? Regulatory changes? Industry trends? Same pattern, different keywords.

**To fellow tech leaders:** What manual research tasks are you still doing that could be automated? Sometimes the best productivity hack is 100 lines of Python and a cron job.
